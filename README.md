# Project-1
The goal of my code was to make a working basic calulator that computes different operations based on user input. 
Lines 3-7 act as the initial prompts the user will receive. It gives the user the four operations they are allowed to work with,Adding, Subtracting, Multiplying, and Dividing, and asks the user to select one. 
Lines 10-17 defines specifically what Python is supposed to do based on what operation the user selects. 
Line 20 provides the user with their first input section where they input the number "1", "2", "3", or "4" which corresponds to the operations provided in lines 3-7. 
Lines 22 and 23 gives the user their second input section where they input the two numbers they wish to compute. 
Lines 26-39 is where Python looks to see which operation the user inputted, and performs the functions specified in lines 10-17. It then should return to the user, the computed function and its solution.  
NOTE: Lines 38 and 39 is an additional code that is supposed to act as an error message for the user in case they do not input one of the numbers in line 20 (1, 2, 3, or 4) that corresponds to an operation. For example, when prompted to choose which operation they wish to use, if they input the number "5", the code should return this error until they select a number that corresponds to one of the operations.
